  # So, we always use the stubs provided by `cuda_cudart` and rely on `cudaRunpathFixupHook` to add
  # `cuda_compat`'s `libcuda.so` to the RPATH of our libraries -- importantly, *before* the driver libraries so that
  # the compatibility library is used first.
  # Since the libraries in `cuda_compat` are all under the `compat` directory, we don't run into issues where there are
  # multiple versions of `libcuda.so` in the environment.
  # NOTE: `cuda_compat` can be disabled by setting the package to `null`. This is useful in cases where
  # the host OS has a recent enough CUDA driver that the compatibility library isn't needed.
